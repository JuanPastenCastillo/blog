      "The most general definition of leadership is understood as a person who influences their reference group, achieving collective effectiveness. With this definition, the leader is the protagonist, since in that role they are the cause of results.",

      `There are as many theories as there are thinkers in the world, however, there are some that will be useful to explain leadership:`,
      `1) Trait Theory: a leader is effective if they exhibit certain personal qualities that are above those of other people. These qualities have to do with skills, knowledge, experience, and personality traits that are superior to the rest (García, 2014).`,
      `2) Behavioral theories of leadership focus less on innate traits and more on what a leader does, how they do it, and the patterns they use to influence a group or organization. This approach includes classifications such as autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire leadership, as well as leaders who are task-focused versus those who are relationship-focused. (García, 2014).`,
      `3) Contingency: here, neither traits nor behaviors alone guarantee the existence of a leader, as it always needs a context to manifest itself. These characteristics of the environment can be:`

  [
    "indent2",
    [
      `* Leader-member relations: how much the leader is liked by their followers, how much they trust and are loyal to him or her.`,
      `* Task structure: how clear and well-designed the tasks are.`,
      `* Position power: what is the legitimate power of the position, how much reward or coercive capability the leader has according to the position they hold.`,
      `* From this approach, a good leader is one with the ability to adapt to the context by manifesting the most appropriate leadership style for each situation, being effective when they know how to do the following four verbs: direct, persuade, participate, and delegate (García, 2014).`

      `* Transactional leadership is often more useful in environments where the end goal is planned, the expected results, the means that will be used, and when it will begin. It is, therefore, directive, rewarding and motivating expected behaviors. It also seeks to reduce contingencies as much as possible (Contreras & Barbosa, 2013).`,
      `* Transformational leadership is often used in periods of crisis, as it favors adaptation in unstable environments with little predictability. This leadership seeks to transform followers, making their personal needs motivations that tend to fulfill organizational objectives. Likewise, it establishes high values and motivates followers to be leaders and leaders to be moral agents. This is expected to make employees do more than expected, stimulating commitment, loyalty, motivation, and innovation (Contreras & Barbosa, 2013).`

      `5) Transcultural leadership: according to a project based on over 160 research studies and the examination of 62 societies around the world, it was found that the attributes universally accepted in all cultures are charismatic leadership and team orientation (Gil, Alcover, Rico & Sánchez-Manzanares, 2011).`

  [`title2`, `Followers, subordinates, and their characteristics.`],
  [

    [
      `Let's clarify the difference between subordinate and follower: the subordinate assumes a passive role, their behavior is determined by the perceptions, emotions, and influences of the leader; the follower, on the other hand, can be someone who defends, antagonizes, or is indifferent towards someone of higher rank. It is the followers who commit to a common purpose that the leader communicates, they are the ones who believe in the organization's mission and vision, they are the ones who make an organization thrive, and they are the ones who can be a leader one day or a follower the next, in a process that is repeated in communication with others  (García, 2014).`,
      `The good follower develops the following three characteristics for a good relationship with the leader:`,
      `1) Commitment: this is the mutual loyalty and trust between those who interact. It is not a free competitive advantage, leaders must earn it and it is granted by followers. Both parties exchange points of view, put their liberties into play and when they find a point in common on which they agree, they can negotiate to agree that this will be the promise that commits them to changing circumstances in the future.`,
      `2) Responsibility: If the follower wants to have power, they must accept both their own role and the leader's responsibility. By accepting this dual responsibility, they can assume both organizational and personal responsibilities. This point is divided into three:`

  [
    "indent2",
    [
      `* The follower must understand the power they have and how they can use it. Followers are the source of power, they must be aware of who they serve and what tools they have, as a group, to assume personal and organizational missions. They must learn to manage the power they have to deliver it to the leader and thus serve a common purpose.`,
      `* They must learn to recognize the importance of the leader and accept feedback from them.`,
      `* Followers must understand the seduction and traps of power.`

      "3) Communication process: every collaborator must know what the leader communicates and, in turn, every leader must know the contributions of their collaborators. This applies in all directions within the organization: top-down, bottom-up, horizontal, diagonal, outside and inside."
    ]

  [`title2`, `Follower, leader and power.`],
  [
    "content",
    [
      `To understand the power of the leader, first it is necessary to understand the followers and the level of trust they have with the leader (Contreras & Castro, 2013). In other words, if the source of the leader's power is the followers, then leadership depends more on the followers than on the leader's characteristics. Leadership thus becomes a bilateral process between leader and follower, which has three consequences: first, the leader subordinates himself to the personal aspirations of the follower and, in return, the follower grants him power. Second, both roles rotate, so the social imperative to always be a leader is impossible to fulfill (García, 2014). And third, trust is the most important factor in generating change because it will cause employees to become followers rather than passive individuals or, in the worst case, to desert the organization (Contreras & Castro, 2013).`,
      `Followers, on the other hand, are not a homogeneous group; each person has their own perceptions, desires, and leadership needs. Knowing this, the responsibilities that some people assume within the organization or others will depend on their particularities and their relationship with the leader.`,
      `What behaviors are expected of followers towards leaders? According to Davis & Newstrom (2000, cited by Garcia, 2014):`,
      `1) Not competing with the leader for attention.`,
      `2) Being loyal and supportive as a team member.`,
      `3) Not automatically agreeing with everything.`,
      `4) Thinking "how could this go wrong?"`,
      `5) Constructively confronting the leader's ideas, values, and actions.`,
      `6) Anticipating and preventing potential problems.`

      `In trait theory, a leader will only be recognized as such if they exhibit individual characteristics and behaviors that followers have internalized as what it means to be a leader. In contingency theory, it will be the context and the subordinates themselves that will give the leader the opportunity to choose the appropriate leadership for the situation. For emerging, transactional, and transformational theories, the follower will be constantly trading with the leader, giving him what he wants, and in those circumstances, the leader can give to ensure his effectiveness in achieving goals (García, 2014).`

  [`title2`, `Other concepts associated with leadership.`],
  [
    "content",
    [
      `1) Leadership as a process affects group work, social climate, and outcomes (Evkall & Wyhammar, 1997; Kahai & Sosik, 1997, cited by García, 2014). Along with other factors such as processes, products, services, people, and approaches, it explains organizational outcomes (Rahman, 2001, cited by García, 2014).`,
      `2) When a leader is transformational, that is, they supervise while valuing the contributions of their collaborators, incentivize their behavior, and attend to their needs, job satisfaction increases. Job satisfaction not only affects the work context, but is also related to overall life satisfaction, which in a global economy is a competitive advantage for organizations (Omar, 2011).`,
      `3) When the leader (both transformational and transactional) is considerate, concerned, and closely supervises the task at hand, the employee's motivation and job satisfaction increase significantly. If the leader maintains these characteristics but supervises the tasks remotely rather than in the field, motivation and job satisfaction would decrease slightly. On the other hand, if the leader is inconsiderate, disrespectful, uncooperative, and has close supervision, the levels of motivation and job satisfaction would decrease significantly.`,
      `On the other hand, a task-oriented leader will be perceived as such if, in addition, they are people-oriented. This could be explained because goals cannot be achieved without a good image of a people-oriented leader, and vice versa. It could be thought that when leadership occurs, it does so with all its dimensions (Cuadra-Peralta & Veloso-Besio, 2010).`,
      `4) A leader can influence the organizational climate and risk factors, however, they are not the only ones who do so since there are other actors. Intervening in risks is important because they hinder the function, individual performance, and strategic objectives within the organization, while intervening in the climate means valuing the human factor and being socially responsible. Knowing this, in a psychosocial risk context, a task-oriented leader (with the quality of establishing clear norms and control) will make employees perceive fewer risks, while, in the same context, a people-oriented leader (without that normative and control quality) will make employees perceive more risks. However, the people-oriented leader can indirectly alleviate risks, as their actions tend to improve the work environment, which in turn decreases the perception of risk. This does not happen with the task-oriented leader, as they tend to worsen the climate, which in turn increases psychosocial risk (Contreras, Juárez, Barbosa, & Uribe, 2010). Therefore, in a risk context, one can choose to maintain the current state by controlling employees and worsening the climate, or alternatively, one can choose to improve the climate and indirectly reduce risk factors with a people-oriented leadership approach.`,
      `5) The leader has a privileged and boundary role in relation to the stress of their collaborators, as they assume different roles in different moments, contexts, and contingencies where they operate (representing, assessing, filtering, translating information, cushioning impacts, negotiating and transacting), thus enhancing or mitigating the stress of their collaborators. Transformational leadership has been indicated as the best method for transforming demand into a challenge and opportunity, disregarding that it may be a threat. However, one must beware of demagogy and leaders who only seek personal interest to the detriment of the common good, of the collective (Peiró & Rodríguez, 2008).`,
      `6) Different ways exist to stimulate an innovation climate in an organization (Pons & Ramos, 2012):`

  [
    `indent2`,
    [
      `* Inspirational leadership: in their dealings with employees, the leader encourages them to take on and fulfill the mission, promotes their self-confidence, and stimulates them to develop their ideas. This should be accompanied by the possibility of putting new skills into play and being open to the risk of making mistakes.`,
      `* Reciprocal symbolic exchange: the leader interacts with employees not from the perspective of "I give so that you give," but rather from the perspective of symbolic interaction in which one party gives with the expectation that the other will give, when and how they can, what they have in terms of symbolic equivalence.`,
      `* Motivation to participate in general, promoted by the organization. This also promotes commitment among employees.`,

      `* Forming and developing people.`,
      `* Sharing relevant information.`

      `Although leadership is more complex than what has been presented so far, the goal of providing many perspectives on the topic is to give concepts to think about the phenomenon and to evaluate the particular situation in which the person receiving these words is involved. However, it is suggested to follow different behaviors in order to put into practice what has been said here`,
      `1) Know your job description and profile as well as the job description and profile of the people you will be leading.`,
      `2) Grow the professional qualities of your collaborators or followers through one-on-one feedback, which means orchestrating individual meetings with the people you want to develop in their current or future job position following the G.R.O.W. framework (which stands for "grow" in English):`

      `3) More information about these meetings: you can consider the meeting successful when you listened to 80% of it and spoke only the remaining 20%; these meetings can last at least 10 minutes and should be held at least once a month.`,
      `4) If you don't have time to hold these meetings and can only inquire about problems, do so by starting with "why." For example: "why did you do the task this way," "why did you talk to me in that manner," "why didn't you like the work I presented," "why do you want to make that change."`,
      `5) If you are not interested in staying in the organization or growing your collaborators, do not hold one-on-one meetings or provide feedback.`,
      `6) When giving orders to your collaborators, always explain the why behind them. It's very different to follow an order when you know why you're doing it (as Nietzsche once said, 'He who has a why to live for can accept  any how').`,
      `7) When you are a leader, your time no longer belongs to you, it belongs to the team. Additionally, it is recommended to use some form of organization to manage your daily, weekly, monthly, and other necessary tasks.`,
      `8) Google found that the best thing a leader can do with their collaborators is to provide psychological safety (allowing them to make mistakes without suffering consequences). Other qualities that promote good leadership include motivating task fulfillment, valuing talent and work ethics. Other qualities, which are less important, include structuring and being clear about tasks, working with meaning, and achieving impact in the work.`,
      `A bit more on the development of psychological safety: one should not punish, but rather point out mistakes. This is very important because we will all make mistakes, and assuming a culture of accepting mistakes allows us to think that "it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission." With a culture like that, employees keep doing things without waiting for the leader's approval to try (if so, that leader becomes the bottleneck). Following this line, it is a mistake to fire someone who makes an important mistake, because when you investigate why the mistake was made in a one-on-one interview (as long as it was not made with malice), you can be sure that the employee will not make the same mistake again. Mistakes are not inherited, so firing the person and hiring someone else does not guarantee that it will not happen again, as the new employee may not even know that they could make such a mistake.`,
      `9) A leader should be a generalist and not a specialist, they should know a little bit about everything that their organization does.`,
      `10) It's important to know what is going on with your team members, as having more information allows you to make more informed decisions. Knowing your team members is essential for empathizing with them. If you act without this knowledge or forget something important, you may make a decision that breaks the empathy`,
      `11) The leader should delegate what they do best, so that they can more easily guide others in what they know well.`,
      `12) The leader does whatever is necessary for the team, including getting coffee.`,
      `13) A leader should earn the respect of everyone, not be liked by everyone. When a leader does what is best for their team and the organization, they may make some enemies. Collaborators usually realize that while they may not like the leader, they understand that the leader is helping them grow.`,
      `14) A leader should provide organizational information to those who need to have it and manage it, those who don't have control should not know it, because if they know it, uncertainty increases in circumstances they don't control. A good leader is concerned with creating optimal organizational conditions so that employees only worry about doing their job well, which is why the leader filters information. However, when things are going wrong and need to be communicated, they are communicated, it's not about maintaining the appearance that everything is always fine. It must be judged on a case-by-case basis.`,
      `15) And because a good leader not only gives feedback, but also must learn to receive it, the following is listed for this purpose:`
    ]
  ],
  [
    `indent2`,
    [
      `* Disconnect your ego, your belief in superiority over others.`,
      `* Discard the useless. If the feedback is bad, let it go, don't express it.`,
      `* Receive the useful without judging. Perhaps the feedback itself is bad, but there is something you can salvage.`,
      `* Don't challenge the feedback. You don't have to win every argument.`,
      `* Don't shield yourself by saying that you don't receive feedback because others don't know how to give it well.`,
      `* And, no matter how bad the feedback is, always show gratitude.`
