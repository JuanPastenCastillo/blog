      "1) What have other companies or countries that make them a successful: money, knowledge, opportunities, population/demography, necessity, technology, luck, other? In China, for this question, Courtney McColgan answer that a strong government in the projects they start and the continuation they make of them."

      `3) The companies growh while the team growh but also when the founders and CEO's growh. The question here is: how the team and Founders/CEO are learning new things and improve the things that they already know. For the experience of Courtney McColgan she sayd that all the knowledge she have, all the skills, have some purpose before she start to learned: chinese language because she want to learn from chinese micro credit; photoshop because she don't like the speed of designers to make something, spanish language because she want to work in Latin America. A little reflexion here: maybe for some people is good to be in a position where he can't have any excuse to not learn that.`

      `When companies raise inversion that is the first step, because after that the company must transform that inversion to growth. And the way to have a exponential growth (2x, 3x, 10x) is optimizing the process and for this you need a product owner of every single process.`

      `6) What should a company do to give people, to the team, the security to taking risk of appropiating an idea? The leader here is the responsible person to achieve the project in time and quality, this is not only create a website is have conversation with all the stakeholders involved in the project, coordinate efforts, create a timeline, make updates, rise the hand when the things are not doing well and know what we going to do. This help to line up the expectatives of all the people involved in the project.`

      `7) Founders are persons who mentally live in the future (five to ten years) but their bodies are in today. So, one thing that can generate this is frustration. The question here: which thing of the environment you would change "the frustration is the opportunity".`

      `8) The founders are a different type of person who do the things he do because a mission, not because they only want to be rich. For the experience of Freddy Vega, the 100% of Founders who sold the company and became rich feel depressed after that sale "i don't know what to do", "i sold to quickly". The thing to reflect here is: money don't hive happiness. After certain amount of money your quality life don't improve. So, if your job have a meaning, everyday, no matter the good or the bad things, is wonderful. In which other industries would you like to participate?`

      `9) Founders take decisions quickly with uncomplete data. They way that they do are the so call "first principles" or "fundamental principles". They are absolute truths or very close to absolute truths that guide the decisions. For example in Platzi they think: a person who is dedicated, with a computer with conexion to internet, can learn anything in the industry of technology. With this you can make decisions without re evaluate thing over and over again with new experiences and environments. The question here is: which are your first princniples, fundamental principles who guide your activity as founder? Courtney McColgan answer this with her experience when she was a child and what her mother teach her: "you can achieve anything you want, it would some effort, will take more or less time, but you can achieve it, no doubt". And, when the interview was make it with Freddy Vega, she had no doubt that the product of her company will become success.`
