      "Who is the most important person in a company. If you have a only one person in wathever position who is the most important person, that company have to re estructurate the company because good companies have not 'heroes' or 'super employees' who makes everything. Is unavoidable that CEO be the most visible person in a company but is not the most important person. In this sense there is differents ways to be a CEO, for example: who is the CEO os SAP, Delta Arilines, Sennheiser, BMW, Chevrolet but everyone knows who is Elons Musk (SpaceX and Tesla), Satia Nadela (Microsoft). There's many things to remember but companies are not individuals, because individuals accomplish little things, people who truly get big things accomplish that in teams, the teams change the world. And here are a difference: individuals can start a flame but they cannot stop a fire."

      "CEO can be hired. For example, right now Satia Nadela was not the founder of Microsoft, the founders of Microsoft was Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer. Founders start the idea from scratch and they are willing to take the risk. Majority of founders will not accomplish nothing in his lifed, everything they will try to do they will lose it. This is a hard and ugly reality, but is real. For this reason is a good approach to not get attach to the final goal, is better focus on the whole process.",
      "Continuing with the sad reality of founders, is very possible that you use ten years of your life to an idea that doesn't work or report you zero money. For example the founder of Pebble, Eric Migicovsky, finish with nothing. He has the most invested project in the history of kick started, three times in a row, was the creator of smarth watch, he lift over forty million of dollars, he sold his company and he finish with zero money.  The only thing he has was the salary (by the way, his salary was the 40% of what an engineer won in his context, ergo, enough to survive). This is what difference founder to other people. Other thing: the risk of everything or nothing, founder put all the eggs in only one basket. All the things have to be said: if you born in a poor or medium class family, is the most efficient way to have an high economic mobility because the advantage of business (if you choose the correct market) it is a true meritocracy. But also is something very hard, no one owes you nothing and this is something you face day a day. "
