      "Normally when the community become huge emerging phenomenons appear, like simple things like funny meme to myths and characteristic human behavior in the community. A question to founders: which emergin phenomenon surpirse you that appear in your community? Something that you didn't expected, something good and something bad.",
      "Another question following the past question: if are something that surprise and was something bad, how do you manage that? For Freddy Vega he said that he saw in the healthy communities that are very clear of which thing are not allow. Isn't possible to have a community without rules. A question for you community: which things are not allowed in your community and, therefore, maintain the magic of that community? For the perspective of Pedro Henrique he said that they are in a bigger thing that is the Hip Hop culture, so the respect and knowing that you comes from an environment allow certain rules.",
      `Another question if you are the first in certain field: why your business doesn't exist before? Knowing all the things you know and the reason why you are commited with the mision, why no one else start this business before you?`,
      `A question: what Founders do is live in the future, the work is always in the future but the daily work is keep the company alive. So, where do you think would be your company in the next five or ten years and the industry in general?`,
      `A question: what state is your company's industry in and where is that industry headed?`,
      `A question: which are the breakpoints in terms of ammount of people working on your company? For example how is feel your company with 5 employee, 10, 20, 30, 100, 200 and more.`,
      `A question: how do you define the culture on your company? In some business school exist a sentence: "culture eat strategy for breakfast". The question here is for the definition, the details about it and the way it works.`,
      `A question: with your co-founder, how do you know him/her? And how do you divide the roles?`,
      `A question: what is the worst and the best of have a company on your industry, at a personal level not from the company? Is usual to make answer politically correct, that don't hurt anybody, but please be raw honest from the deep of your heart. First with the worst and after that the best (in the best is prohibited make the scripted answer "the best are our clients, our audience" and so on).`,
      `Remember a sentence from Fredy Vega: "A StartUp is a chaotic shit show, doesn't matter the size". When the startup get bigger the shit show is biggerr and more spectacular. Some people think that is sexy to be a Founder or CEO but is very hard and very painful hire people, fire people, balance the financial states of the company and so on.`,
      `An advice from Pedro Henrique of Urban Roosters for all the people who is want to start in tech industry or music: please, don't have fear, just try it. Don't seek a perfect momento to start, that doesn't exist, the perfect momento is make the first step. You can have a good or bad step as all the things of life, you just have to try it. And a warm from Pedro is: is hard, is not easy, but nothing in life is easy. Please found something that make you motivated, that wake the passion on you and go ahead.`
