      `The most important thing of the five point is the psycologic security. All the teams will make mistakes, all of them. Not only the teams, every human beign will make mistakes. In a creative process you will face the mistakes all the time because this is the path for creating something new. If you are in a safe zone, you are not creating a new thing, you are following instructions.`,

If in general people around the leader ask all the time for permission to the leader, this person is the bottleneck at certain point. On the other hand, if the team always is doing things eventually they will do interest things and errors too. With the errors people will learn. One of the major mistakes of companies is fired people who make a big (honest and innocent) errors, with no evil behind. This person will never make this mistake in his life, never.
