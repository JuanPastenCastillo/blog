      `A question: which are the lessons you have after 35 year in technology? The answer of Claudio Pinkus for this was: "I always like to keep learning, after doing something by some time i get bored and i want to learn something new. But this have two answer for the technology side and entrepeneur side: in technology if you know what is hapen today you will not know what is going to be tomorrow, can be or not related with the past, and you have to start again. Know the past is not a guarranty to know what is coming. For the entrepeneur side: the most important is keep standing, will be so many moments when you going to doubt or maybe what is happen will not allow you to get your goals but if you keep with the vision, clarity, force, keep standing, getting the neccesary tools, the capital, the help, the equipment, the will, all this things and keep standing when the boal will be on your side you will be able to score a goal". Is most important to be a cockroach than an unicorn, the first one survive nuclear explosions. Companies only need have luck one time and if you keep alive at some day, that lucky day will arive.`
