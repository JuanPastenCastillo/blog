      "Who is the most important person in a company. If you have a only one person in wathever position who is the most important person, that company have to re estructurate the company because good companies have not 'heroes' or 'super employees' who makes everything. Is unavoidable that CEO be the most visible person in a company but is not the most important person. In this sense there is differents ways to be a CEO, for example: who is the CEO os SAP, Delta Arilines, Sennheiser, BMW, Chevrolet but everyone knows who is Elons Musk (SpaceX and Tesla), Satia Nadela (Microsoft). There's many things to remember but companies are not individuals, because individuals accomplish little things, people who truly get big things accomplish that in teams, the teams change the world. And here are a difference: individuals can start a flame but they cannot stop a fire."

      "CEO can be hired. For example, right now Satia Nadela was not the founder of Microsoft, the founders of Microsoft was Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer. Founders start the idea from scratch and they are willing to take the risk. Majority of founders will not accomplish nothing in his lifed, everything they will try to do they will lose it. This is a hard and ugly reality, but is real. For this reason is a good approach to not get attach to the final goal, is better focus on the whole process.",
      "Continuing with the sad reality of founders, is very possible that you use ten years of your life to an idea that doesn't work or report you zero money. For example the founder of Pebble, Eric Migicovsky, finish with nothing. He has the most invested project in the history of kick started, three times in a row, was the creator of smarth watch, he lift over forty million of dollars, he sold his company and he finish with zero money.  The only thing he has was the salary (by the way, his salary was the 40% of what an engineer won in his context, ergo, enough to survive). This is what difference founder to other people. Other thing: the risk of everything or nothing, founder put all the eggs in only one basket. All the things have to be said: if you born in a poor or medium class family, is the most efficient way to have an high economic mobility because the advantage of business (if you choose the correct market) it is a true meritocracy. But also is something very hard, no one owes you nothing and this is something you face day a day. "

      "So many people want's to be a CEO but this is maybe for ignorance, they don't know what means be a CEO. Is like to be a president, because they think they will be THE BOSS. In reallity presidents and CEO have a limited field of power (some exceptions apply). CEO are the visible face of the company but not always can do whatever they want (for example, CEO canot change the business model of the company when the company is in certain point). I mean, it's posibble but they must convince the team (because if is not, the team will go or they will get bored with low performance), boards of directors (investors), to the co founder and the market (the users, clients, all the people who recognize the company as it is right now).",
      "What do a CEO is very simple but is not easy:",
      "1) The CEO must define the direction of the company, the vision, what to do and, specially, what not to do. With a methapor: when a ball is rolling and no one stop it, the CEO takes the decision of stop it (because if this is not maded the problem will be bigger). Make the final decision of all the things. Is who have the last word. If the company is a good company, this will not be their responsibility because other people will catch that problem sooner. Sintesis: define the vision, what to do and specially what not to do.",
      "2) Make the company survive. Is very easy to know when a company dies: is when the money runs out. The thing here, what's going to happen if the CEO or the Founders died, those human beings died, the company is prepared to keep his existence? If they have money, yes. How the money runs out: users don't want to buy, there is no cash flow, when isn't possible to raise inversion when the company is not profitable. In one word: the company doesn't have money in the bank and therefore is not possible pay salaries. This thing happen all the time. Example: Blockbuster. A curious data: es very rare that companies have most lifespan tha humans, there a very little companies that live more than fifty years.",
      "3) Have the best possible team. A tipic error is call themself family because you cannot fired your mother, making a performance review to your son or simple hired other family member, like a different brother. There a detail: for persons around you who are against your dignity and/or your human rights, please get away from those persons, not matter which title they have: mother, father, brother, girlfriend, friend, co worker, boss, etcetera. Companies are teams of high performance, like a football team, if someone is not accomplish the goals in their position, he has to leave the team. The detail here is how much opportunities should have a person in their role and which variables you must take in account to make that decision. This means: hire the correct person and detect when the person doesn't fit with the team.",
      "4) This final point of what do a CEO day a day is very rare: do whatever makes you happy. In general, if your companny will doing very well, the last thing you going to do is the thing you love. For this, is a hard reality for those who want to be a CEO, they think they will make the things they make them happy. Is very difficult if the company will do great, if is not, is just a failure (and therefore wisdom for next opportunities)."

      "2) Life is unfairly correlated with the people you meet. If you born poor and you relate with poor people you will stay poor. If you born rich and you relate with rich people you will stay rich. Good news: if you know and understand this you can start to change your network. Other thing: this explain why you are not doing so well in life: if your friends are alcoholic persons who wants to work less and drink more you will do that; if you have people around you who tell you that you can't do something, they are losers, even if they are full of love and good intentions, no matter which title this persons have: father, mother, friends, co-workers and etcetera, those people will drive to you to their mental state: you can't. Advice here: stop associating with those people, no matter which title they have. For all the things exist exceptions: maybe some people you can't or you don't want to make distance from them because they are emotional close to you, okay, just don't define what are you cappable of do related with those people."
