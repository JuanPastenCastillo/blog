      `In the laws of physics we find the second law of thermodynamics, which is the law of entropy. This law states that matter and energy tend towards disorder, and in this universe everything is moving away from each other, leading towards thermal death. However, the formulas that define entropy have the opposite sign to the formula that defines information. That being said, matter and energy, governed by the laws of entropy, measure the degree of disorder; information measures the degree of order of a system. These are two opposing polarities: matter and energy on one hand, and information on the other.

      `Following the phrase "as above so below", we can transfer the teaching, the evolutionary information of plants to human beings and how we can use it in adapting to life. If you have a plant growing next to a window where sunlight enters, the plant will lean towards the sunlight. How does it do this if it doesn't have muscles, actins, myosins, and the molecules that allow it to do so? This is interesting: light enters from one side and creates shade on the other, and on the side where there is no light, it grows, producing more gibberellins (plant growth hormone) on one side than on the other. This is how it leans towards the light. Plants teach us: we grow through the shade (through pandemics, crises, or occasional stress). Also note the flowers: mimosa or sunflower, when there is light they open, when there is shade they close. This is the phenomenon of opening: the plant grows from the center or from the periphery. If there is more growth from the center then the plant opens up to the light. So, it is growing from the shade and growing from the center (of the heart).`,

      `We nourish ourselves from five different sources of prana that nourish the first five chakras or energy centers. We also have the energy of emotions (which literally means energy in motion). Emotions nourish an energetic oscillator, a quantum oscillator that is the heart. What drains you the most energetically are your emotions, you nourish yourself with your emotions, you nourish yourself with the image you have of yourself. If this image of yourself is inadequate, pessimistic, toxic, made up of complexes, you have 4 times (or 400%) more chances of getting sick and dying from all causes, compared to people who are optimistic (this is known from prospective studies, of more than 60 years, what is the prognosis of a person who has a good self-image?). Everything is a nutrient. The image we have of ourselves is the image we have of the world ultimately, what one does in life is to project one's own stuff onto the world. The heart is a generator of quantum energy, this seems mysterious and unscientific but has been well documented for over three decades by researchers at the Heart Math Institute. They have found that there is emotional nutrition in addition to light malnutrition (much of what happens to us in the West, due to fear of cancer, adequate contact with the sun). Most diseases are related to an inadequate self-image: if we have a bad self-image, we do not love ourselves, we do not take care of ourselves, we mistreat ourselves, we do not eat well, we consume toxic junk, because we do not appreciate ourselves, because we do not value ourselves. Here there is an essential component in nutrition: the image we have of ourselves - nutrition from a cultural perspective. You cannot change the diet by decree, you have to adapt to each culture`,

      `The heart detects the most powerful magnetic field in the body. This hologram contains information from the universe, from the quantum field. This is not a comparison, it is a reality: the universe is in your heart as a quantum field. Your heart is nourished by your emotions. When there is coherence, joy, honesty, transparency, goodwill, compassion, solidarity, and love in your life, the field of the heart becomes ordered and orders the city of life. Here we are not referring to medications or supplements that may have an effect on the heart (such as manganese, which protects the vascular system as a trace element, coenzyme Q10, which increases the potential of the cardiac mitochondria, Ginko Biloba, which favors microcirculation, olive leaves for hypertension, and everything else that serves for cardio-angiosclerosis). We are going a little further, to emotional nutrition. You could have perfect nutrition but fear malnourishes you, fear poisons you, fear creates free radicals, fear generates inflammation, fear overloads your adrenal glands, fear floods you with cortisol (which is hyperglycemic), fear generates metabolic syndrome. In other words, you can do everything right but if you are not attentive to this other type of nutrition, no matter what you do, you will be in a dynamic of energy saving, of calorie saving because you are in a state of artificial hibernation syndrome (like bears that seek refuge in their cave, accumulate weight to survive the winter months). When human beings see an affective winter in the future, they generate a syndrome of seasonal affective depression that is not only due to the absence of light, but also due to the absence of a future in their life, of opportunities in their life when those affective winters come. For example, in chronic illness, we find three key factors (just by addressing these we would already be the best therapists in the world): A) Stress: personal or transpersonal. Stress is not just what happens when I run because I'm going to miss my train. Stress is what I am not aware of, the constant inner struggle with myself, not being content with myself, the permanent neurosis that keeps me in a crisis of meaning and prevents me from finding my inner self. This is the main cause of stress. Stress creates inflammation (it is not the only cause of inflammation), it is pro-inflammatory in itself. This is not the stress of low threshold, permanent, sustained stress that causes insomnia, can lead to hypertension, flooding of cortisol, the kind of stress that we are not aware of. We are not talking about the stress of high intensity, the one we can adapt to. B) Inflammation. Not the acute kind, we defend ourselves well against that. It is rather the low-threshold inflammation that we are not aware of, the inflammation that is chronically sustained often due to stress. C) The first two points cause alterations in the immune system. This alteration implies having a hyper-excited immune system that consumes all our energy reserves, we are consuming more than 100% of our energy. The consequence of this is that the brain paralyzes us, if we consume more energy than we produce the brain sends us to bed or generates fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome or an energy depression syndrome`,

      `(...) from the systemic conception of life (we are talking about life), life is a pattern of dynamic organization (constantly changing like a river) and intelligent (has algorithms, is ordered). This pattern of organization, which is like a wave, precipitates onto a particle: in this case, the body. From physics, the body is a structure on the edge of chaos: here we are talking about systemic sciences such as chaos theory - the study of the laws of chaos. Understanding a living organism, a plant, a human being, a dynamic and complex molecular interaction is understanding the laws of chaos. So, a dissipative structure, being on the edge of chaos, is governed by the laws of chaos. One of those laws of chaos is sensitivity; life is exquisitely sensitive (we cannot kill flies with a sledgehammer). One of the great keys to life is the dialogue through the resonance of harmonic communications. It is not a quantitative problem (it is not only measured in milligrams or kilograms of weight); here the quality, the information that we give, which can be ordering, is essential. The body is a dissipative structure with an essential characteristic. This quality was discovered by Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine, a Russian naturalized Belgian: chaos is reversible. This is fundamental for anyone who studies life, who studies biology or medicine or therapy. This ultimately means that disease can be reversible. There is an ordering stimulus that can create re-ordering. Disease is disorder, chaos; health is order. Although the level of disorder may be advanced, at least in theory and often seen in practice, disease can return to levels of order and superior health, even in chronic disease, which we did not believe was possible. We are not condemned to age-related diseases; that does not exist; it is what we do with life. We are destined to die in a healthy way. This is a matter of the relationship between the wave, which is information, and the dissipative structure we call the body. Systemic scientists call this interaction learning; this means that living is learning.

Mistakes also, errors are also a teacher. Life is a learning process: whether you succeed or fail`,

      `From the 1960s until 2020, the cost of the healthcare system has increased 174 times (Amadeo, 2022). By the year 2023, an increase of more than 50% in chronic diseases is forecasted (Bodenheimer et al., 2009). And medical outcomes account for only 10% of health outcomes. The impact from various domains on early deaths can be distributed roughly as follows: genetic predisposition, about 30 percent; social circumstances, 15 percent; environmental exposures, 5 percent; behavioral patterns, 40 percent; and shortfalls in medical care, 10 percent. But more important than these proportions is the nature of the influences in play where the domains intersect. Ultimately, the health fate of each of us is determined by factors that act not mostly in isolation but by our experience where domains interconnect. Whether a gene is expressed can be determined by environmental exposures or behavioral patterns. The nature and consequences of behavioral choices are affected by our social circumstances. Our genetic predispositions affect the healthcare we need, and our social circumstances affect the healthcare we receive (McGinnis et al., 2002). We can say that The 80% of our health are things we can self-manage, such as our relationship with the environment, electromagnetic environment, and lifestyle factors such as nutrition, dietary supplementation, exercise, sleep quality, and daily habits`,

Also prevent at long term cognitive losses, memory alterations, demency, and so on.`,
      `2) Stimulate the velocity at which you incorporate new information.

A study of Salis (2013) show that making a high intensity exercise before a class allow people learn new words in other language 20% faster than people who have stood still. The reason is because your brain learn something new need to move and modify their structure or even produce new neurons.

      `The Wim Hof method is a technique developed by the Dutchman Wim Hof. It's based on three pillars: meditation, breathing technique, and gradual exposure to cold. It is said to have many benefits for health and sports performance.`,
      `Meditation is a mindfulness practice that helps to relax the body and mind. The breathing technique is an exercise consisting of deep inhalation and exhalation in a rhythmic way. Gradual cold exposure is a progressive training that involves cold showers, contrast showers, or walking barefoot on snow.`,
      `Here we have the critical perspective of Rohin Francis, that say we can talk about three possible ways to see the Wim Hof Method: probable, posible and no evidence.`,
      `Probable:`,
      `1) Immune system-short term boost.`,
      `2) Mental health.`,
      `3) Stress reduction.`,
      `4) Best quality of sleep.`,
      `5) Willpower.`,
      `6) Arthritis relief (inflammatory).`,
      `7) Asthma management.`,
      `8) COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) management.`,
      `9) Improved cold tolerance.`,
      `10) Altitude sickness.`,
      `Possible:`,
      `1) Energy (vague).`,
      `2) Workout recovery.`,
      `3) Concentration.`,
      `4) Arthitis Relief (wear and tear)`,
      `No evidence:`,
      `1) Immune system-long term.`,
      `2) Sports performance.`,
      `3) Fibromyalgia relief.`,
      `4) Chronic lyme.`,
      `5) Parkinson.`,
      `Resume of the Wim Hof Method:`,
      `1) Probably works via "good" stress.`,
      `2) Meditation has a sound evidence base.`,
      `3) Cold exposures beneficial with prior "priming" of sympathetic nervous system with breathing exercises.`,
      `4) Unclear how long effects last.`

      `3) When breathing, you can use your nose, mouth, or both, just make it happen.`,
      `4) It is suggested to practice this technique in a safe place, sitting or lying down, because it can cause, among other things, micro-fainting. These are harmless in themselves (the body knows how to regulate itself), but if you do it while driving or on the water, they can become very harmful.`,
      `5) While doing the breathing exercises, you may feel different sensations such as dizziness, temperature changes, tingling in different parts of your body, and/or strong emotional reactions such as euphoria. This is normal, do not be alarmed by it. In fact, it is recommended to intensify these sensations.`,
      `6) It is recommended to practice on an empty stomach. It is said that doing it in the morning, while fasting, is an ideal time. However, find the best time for you.`,
      `7) Aim to be fully present when practicing. It is expected that this will not be difficult for you.`,
      `8) This type of breathing technique is not a competition, it is for having a great time. Part of the technique involves holding your breath, but holding it for longer will not necessarily be more beneficial. However, if you want to improve your oxygen retention, you can push that limit.`

      `- In Wim Hof method, the breathing is one pillar from three: meditation and cold exposure, in Buteyko/McKeown breathing is everything.`,
      `- In the Wim Hof breathing technique you can use your mouth or your nose to breath, in Buteyko/McKeown you will use only and exclusively your nose.`,
      `- In Wim Hof you make your body more alkaline, in Buteyko/McKeown you get more tolerant to an acidic state in your body. `,
      `- In Wim Hof you get low levels of O2 and low levels of CO2, with Buteyko/McKeown you get low levels of O2 and high levels of CO2. `,
      `- Wim Hof technique could be very loud, Buteyko/McKeown is by definition quite. `,
      `- You can do Wim Hof several times a day, but one is good enough, Buteyko/McKeown technique es doable several times at day in more scenarios, daily.`,
      `- Wim Hof technique is a tool to control sympathetic nervous system, immune system and inflammation, Buteyko/McKeown focus on a functional breathing, biomechanics, biochemistry, sport performance and recovery.`
