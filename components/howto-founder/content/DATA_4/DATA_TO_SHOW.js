      "1) In general died when they run out of money, when the bank account is zero and cannot afford his obligations. When this happens, the company does not have a product that people want to consume, the company cannot achieve some market place, they did not take care of the bank account.",
      "2) Other reason is suicide: the founder fight or one of them think there is other more interest opportunity. This can happen with any of the partners. More details: in general companies dont died because the competence or the market is suicide, bad decisions.",
      "Found a co-founder is the closest to have a marriage, you start the profesional relationship talking about all the things could happen in the differents possibles scenarios: the company is success, the company fails, the company get inversion, get inversion from the series A, from the series B, the company is bought (make the so call an 'Exit'), some of the co-founder dont want to continue, if the go public (making the so call Initial Public Offer, IPO) and so son.",
      "Decide to have a co-founder is have a relationship for years with other person.",
      "The question here is: what is important for you in the foundation of a company? Advices: put all in paper, your good intentions, the company is divided in certain co-property and all the rules 'what is going to happen if the company ends' what's going to happen with the bank account (divide, continue, one founder leaves, and so on). Is like a map, a route: this is going to happen is everything go good, this is going to happen is everything go bad. Do this with a lawyer and paper."

The reality is the mayor of things is learned in the path, entrepreneurs are people who his life is in constant learning. Without this is very hard. Example of this are the brotherrs Collison, founders of Stripe. They are two developers, they care the technical layer, they are a very good complement as developers but one of them are not better doing business, they have to develop the skills and make decisions: who is going to management the company and other things. But they principal alliance is that they are brothers, in this sense brothers get along very well or very badly. ",

Be pure ambition is the other extreme: a very high arrogant person who no one want to work with. The adviced path is the middle path: seek to get ahead with a open mind knowing that you cannot do all the things alone, you need the help of other people, reciebe feedback and be open to that. Take risk but knowing the path is very long.",
